🔄 Career pivot

Chemical Engineering → Digital Transformation → Computational Biology → Computational Pathology.
I started in Chemical Engineering (Honours), led digital transformation projects in industry (Unilever and Nestle), pivoted to structual biology (Tokyo Tech), and found my home in AI for pathology & spatial omics—building scalable, reproducible pipelines to bridge images and molecules.

--- 
## 🔭 What I’m working on

* **Slide → Gene Expression**
* **Multimodal Fusion**: Combine WSIs + spatial omics + clinical metadata for **subtype** and **risk stratification** in breast cancer.
* **Efficiency @ Scale**: Memory-safe WSI+ST pipelines on HPC (Slurm, Apptainer), using Dask/Zarr where helpful.

## 🧠 Interests

**Computational pathology**, **spatial omics**, **representation learning**, **contrastive/knowledge distillation**, **uncertainty & interpretability**.
